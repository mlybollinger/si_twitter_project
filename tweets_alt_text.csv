I was born in a Tewa matriarch community in northern New Mexico. 

I was raised by women who mud plastered their homes with children on their hips while food simmered in vessels they’d coiled with clay.

Women warriors who move through the portals of creativity believing that building a home and growing food is the same as creating magnificent art. 

Forces of nature who’s ground breaking innovations in clay came from the no nonsense matriarchs who’ve echoed resilience and strength for generations. 

I was born into women who were unaware of western concepts of feminism but who were the standard bearers of the basic concept. 

I was born into a community of women who modeled living an artful life.

The company was in continuous operation until it was bought by Pfizer in 2008. The Wyeth Brothers compressed these 5 grain (325mg) salicylic acid tablets around 1895. European chemists isolated salicylic acid from willow bark and meadowsweet in the early 19th century. Salicylic acid was a potent analgesic and antipyretic, relieving pain, fever, and inflammation, but tended to be very irritating on the stomach. Acetyl-salicylic acid (aspirin) was developed by Bayer at the end of the 19th century as a less-irritating salicylate medicine."

It was a fear not only on the part of the black oppressed, but also in the hearts of the white oppressors. . . Certainly Birmingham had its decent white citizens who privately deplored the maltreatment of Negroes. But they remained publicly silent. It was a silence born of fear—fear of social, political and economic reprisals. The ultimate tragedy of Birmingham was not the brutality of the bad people, but the silence of the good people."

A third, unrelated star lies near the edge of the nebula. The flood of ultraviolet radiation from the faint star’s surface makes the surrounding gases, radiating out from the stars in an oval, glow through fluorescence. The colors were chosen to represent the temperature of the gases. Blue represents the hottest gas, which is confined to the inner region of the nebula. Red represents the coolest gas, at the outer edge. Also revealed is a host of filaments, including one long one that resembles a waistband, made out of dust particles which have condensed out of the expanding gases."

The large galaxy cluster resembles a round cloud of neon blue squiggles, more dense on our left than on our right. Just below the center of this cloud is a light blue shape packed with blurry squiggles. It resembles a mushroom cap on its side, with a thin horizontal stem shaped like an umbrella handle sticking out the bottom, pointing to our left. The mushroom cap is hot gas in the smaller galaxy cluster. The umbrella handle is the wake of hot gas. Although, it's important to remember that small is a relative term. Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravity, containing hundreds or even thousands of individual galaxies.

A red line that resembles a vapor trail left by an airplane cuts through the cloud. It extends from the bottom of the mushroom cap to the upper left of the large blue cloud-like galaxy cluster. This "

The Lagoon Nebula (left) is an area about 4,400 light years from Earth in the Milky Way galaxy where stars are actively forming. This field-of-view shows the southern portion of a large bubble of hydrogen gas, plus a cluster of young stars. The Chandra data (purple) have been combined with infrared data (blue, gold, and white) from the Spitzer Space Telescope in this composite image.

The image on the right shows the star-forming region called RCW 120, which is also in the Milky Way, but slightly farther away at a distance of about 5,500 light years. This view of RCW 120, which has the same wavelengths and colors as the Lagoon composite, contains an expanding bubble of hydrogen gas, about 13 light years across."

This rendering was made using a giant mosaic of data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. In this release, the image is presented both labeled and unlabeled.

 

Across the center of the image is a horizontal, bright purple cloud with a glowing white core. This is the plane of the Milky Way – the disk where most of the Galaxy’s stars reside. The labeled image indicates that within the glowing white core are several star clusters, clouds of gas and dust, and the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*.

Among the 104 point-like X-ray sources in the image, eight so far have been observed to be very bright in X-rays and undergo clear changes in brightness over periods of weeks and years. This means they are excellent candidates to be black holes pulling material from companion stars that are much more massive than the Sun."
